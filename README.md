# quote-negotiation-assistant
A Spring Boot backend that simulates B2B quote negotiation in supply chains using rule-based pricing (tier, region, urgency, volume) and LLM-based overrides from natural language input. Designed with Adapter and Strategy patterns for future extensibility (CSV, APIs, etc.).
